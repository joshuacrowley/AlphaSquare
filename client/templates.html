				<p>AlphaBetter is a multiplayer brain training puzzle. Everyone viewing this webpage sees the same board and letters, and you can see other people's guesses and score in real time!</p>
				<p>The aim of the puzzle is to place all the tiles in their logical positions, with the following rule: <em>no row or column can have the same letter twice</em>.</p>
				<p>If your guess is correct, you’ll get a point towards your winning streak. If you take a guess and get it wrong, your streak will be cleared and your guess will be added to the board, in grey. This will help everyone with their next guess. Only one guess will be displayed at a time, so try and remember everyone's attempts, so you have the best chance of getting it correct.</p>
				<p>The board is set to a specific sequence, so it’s rare that you’ll truly have enough information to place a tile with 100% confidence. You’ll need to use your memory, cognitive flexibility and your own strategies to improve your chances and get a high streak.</p>

			<h3>Why train your brain?</h3>
			<div id="rules">				
				<p><strong>Exercise your cognitive abilities</strong></p>
				<p>Active Memory games are based on cognitive tasks traditionally used to measure the brain’s ability. It's accepted in the scientific community that our brains are much more plastic than previously thought, and can be improved through mental exercises, improved confidence and clever strategies. Active Memory participants are helping the scientific community understand the efficacy of brain training.</p>
				<p><strong>Sharpen your memory and attention</strong></p>
				<p>Active Memory provides a context where you can learn and test effective strategies that work for you, and are transferable to real-life tasks and activities. For example, a technique called ‘chunking’ helps you remember more. Some Active Memory games challenge you to try and group content into equal parts, so they’re easier to recall as a whole – this technique can help you remember every day things like phone numbers and grocery lists.</p>
				<p><strong>Build your confidence</strong></p>
				<p>Your confidence at the task at hand is a huge factor in your performance. When you succeed at new challenges, you’re often challenging assumptions about your ability, and gaining confidence in yourself. This new found confidence can have broad effects on your ability across a range of real-life tasks.</p>
